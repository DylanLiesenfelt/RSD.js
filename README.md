# RSD.js
 Random Story Dungeon, is a choose your own adventure style RPG. RSD uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS and is created by using Electron.js.

  The user navigates a dungeon through a variety of choices, solving puzzles, collecting loot, and fighting monsters.

  The goal is to have fun! I hope you can enjoy my game.
